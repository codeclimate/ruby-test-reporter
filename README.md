# codeclimate-test-reporter

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/codeclimate/ruby-test-reporter/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/codeclimate/ruby-test-reporter)

Collects test coverage data from your Ruby test suite and sends it to Code
Climate's hosted, automated code review service. Based on SimpleCov.

# Important FYIs

Across the many different testing frameworks, setups, and environments, there are lots of variables at play. Before setting up test coverage, it's important to understand what we do and do not currently support:

* **Default branch only:** We only support test coverage for your [default branch](http://docs.codeclimate.com/article/151-glossary-default-branch). Be sure to check out this branch before running your tests.
* **Single payload:** We currently only support a single test coverage payload per commit. If you run your tests in multiple steps, or via parallel tests, Code Climate will only process the first payload that we receive. If you are using a CI, be sure to check if you are running your tests in a parallel mode.

  **Note:** There is one exception to this rule. We've specifically built an integration with [Solano Labs](https://www.solanolabs.com/) to support parallel tests.

  **Note:** If you've configured Code Climate to analyze multiple languages in the same repository (e.g., Ruby and JavaScript), we can nonetheless only process test coverage information for one of these languages. We'll process the first payload that we receive.
* **Invalid File Paths:** By default, our test reporters expect your application to exist at the root of your repository. If this is not the case, the file paths in your test coverage payload will not match the file paths that Code Climate expects. For our Ruby test reporter, [we have a work-around to this issue](http://docs.codeclimate.com/article/220-help-im-having-trouble-with-test-coverage#ruby_sub_folder).

## Installation

This gem requires a user, but not necessarily a paid account, on Code Climate, so if you don't have one the
first step is to signup at: [https://codeclimate.com](https://codeclimate.com). Then:

1. Add this to your Gemfile:

        gem "codeclimate-test-reporter", group: :test

1. Start the test reporter **on the very first line** of your `test_helper.rb` or
  `spec_helper.rb` file:

        require "codeclimate-test-reporter"
        CodeClimate::TestReporter.start

Then set the `CODECLIMATE_REPO_TOKEN` environment variable when you run your build
on your CI server, and the results will show up in your Code Climate account.

The `CODECLIMATE_REPO_TOKEN` value is provided after you add your repo to your
Code Climate account by clicking on "Setup Test Coverage" on the right hand side of your feed.

Please contact hello@codeclimate.com if you need any assistance setting this up.

## Configuration

Certain behaviors of the test reporter can be configured. See the `Configuration`
class for more details. For example, you can change the logging level to not
print info messages:

*Note that the configuration block must come before TestReporter.start.*

```ruby
CodeClimate::TestReporter.configure do |config|
  config.logger.level = Logger::WARN
end

CodeClimate::TestReporter.start
```

Another example for when your Rails application root is not at the root of the git repository root

```ruby
CodeClimate::TestReporter.configure do |config|
  config.path_prefix = "app_root" #the root of your Rails application relative to the repository root
  config.git_dir = "../" #the relative or absolute location of your git root compared to where your tests are run
end

CodeClimate::TestReporter.start
```

### Manual Git Configuration

You can manually provide the required git information if you do not have your git repo available. The
TestReporter will fallback to commandline git, if you don't provide all information.

```ruby
CodeClimate::TestReporter.configure do |config|
  config.git.head = File.read('./GIT_REVISION').strip
  config.git.committed_at = File.read('./GIT_TIMESTAMP').strip
  config.git.branch = File.read('./GIT_BRANCH').strip
end
```




## Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble setting up or working with our test coverage feature, [see our detailed help doc](http://docs.codeclimate.com/article/220-help-im-having-trouble-with-test-coverage), which covers the most common issues encountered.

## Extending Simplecov with other formatters

Since ruby-test-reporter 0.4.0 you can use `CodeClimate::TestReporter::Formatter` as a Simplecov formatter directly. Just add the formatter to your Simplecov formatter in addition to the rest of your configuration:

```ruby
require 'codeclimate-test-reporter'
SimpleCov.start do
  formatter SimpleCov::Formatter::MultiFormatter.new([
    SimpleCov::Formatter::HTMLFormatter,
    CodeClimate::TestReporter::Formatter
  ])
  ...
end
```

## Using with [parallel_tests](https://github.com/grosser/parallel_tests)

Note: This may work with other parallel test runners as long as they run on the same machine.

Be sure you're using `simplecov` `>= 0.9.0`.

Add the following to your `test_helper.rb`/`spec_helper.rb` instead of what is normally required.

```ruby
require 'simplecov'
require 'codeclimate-test-reporter'
SimpleCov.add_filter 'vendor'
SimpleCov.formatters = []
SimpleCov.start CodeClimate::TestReporter.configuration.profile
```

Then after all your tests run, in a rake task or as a build step do:

```
require 'simplecov'
require 'codeclimate-test-reporter'
CodeClimate::TestReporter::Formatter.new.format(SimpleCov.result)
```

## Using with multiple machines

For the time-being, we don't officially support coverage data from parallel test runs. That said, [codeclimate batch](https://github.com/grosser/codeclimate_batch) is a handy work-around that was created by one of our customers.

Note that this solution requires standing up a separate server (like a Heroku instance) that sits between your testing environment and Code Climate. Though this option is not formally supported, if you have an immediate need for parallel testing support, [codeclimate batch](https://github.com/grosser/codeclimate_batch) is a helpful interim solution until we can release our official support for this.

## Help! Your gem is raising a ...

### VCR::Errors::UnhandledHTTPRequestError

Add the following to your spec or test helper:

        VCR.configure do |config|
          # your existing configuration
          config.ignore_hosts 'codeclimate.com'
        end

### WebMock::NetConnectNotAllowedError

Add the following to your spec or test helper:

        WebMock.disable_net_connect!(:allow => "codeclimate.com")

### Gem::InstallError: json requires Ruby version ~> 2.0

Some versions of simplecov after 0.11.2 effectively don't support ruby 1.9.3
due to a loose json dependency that picks the latest version of `json`.

See full explanation of issue: [colszowka/simplecov#511](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/issues/511)

The Code Climate Ruby test reporter supports ruby > 1.9. To run with ruby less
than 2.0, you may need to specify a locked dependency to simplecov 0.11.2 or
json < 2.0 in your project's gemfile:

          gem "codeclimate-test-reporter"
          gem "simplecov", "~> 0.11.2"

### Other communication failures

If you are using a web stubbing library similar to VCR or WebMock which prevent external requests during test runs, you will need configure these libraries to allow Code Climate to make external requests.
